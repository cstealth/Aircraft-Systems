# Aircraft-Systems
## A repo for my Aircraft Systems Class
This Repo contains basic tools for aircraft dynamic and control system simulation. It will be developed as I go through the class. 

## Current features
- Eigen and sciplot Libraries
- CMake integration
- Runge-Kutta ODE Solver
- Wind to Body and Body to Wind axis transforms

## Current usage (for linux)
1. Edit src/main.cpp to do what you need
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. cd src
6. ./main
